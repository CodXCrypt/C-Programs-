<h4>C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions.


 It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on.
